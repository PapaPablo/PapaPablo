I will add stuff later here, I won't do anything other then private projects so it dosn't matter anyway I hope.

for anyone that cares, learning the Godot engine, wanting to go full in into some sort of gamedev, using JS, java and C# for app development, mostly made small sites with react.js, bots with discord.js, school and learning projects with Java, and some small gamedev with C#.
I started using Godot for it's simplicity, my dream would be to make games with grand level simulations, like thouse found in stalker, dwarffortress, and some other games.
